# What is the Command Line Interface?

The command line is an interface to the internals of your computer, as opposed to the graphical user interface (GUI) that we commonly use. Through this course, we'll be using it *a lot*. Here are some resources to get started learning about the command line:

## Treehouse

Treehouse has an extensive course on using the command line interface (CLI) available here: [Console Foundations](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#getting-started-with-the-console).

Treehouse has a monthly fee, but they have a 14 day free trial. Make use of the trial during your prework.

## Your Mission!

Read at least one of the articles, then complete the Treehouse course.

If you've never used the command line before, you may want to review some of these more than once. Make sure not to just read/watch, but really dive into the terminal and use the commands you're learning about.

> NOTE No matter what anybody says, don't install iTerm2 yet. We'll install it later. The built in Terminal for MacOS works fine for learning.
