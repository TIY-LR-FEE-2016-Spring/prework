# Prework

Welcome to Front End Engineering!

Over the next few months, I'll be directing you through one of the most intense, immersive learning experiences of your life. Together with your fellow classmates, you're going to learn *how* to learn efficiently, *what* to focus on when learning new things, and *why* learning is the most impactful skill you can hone as a software developer.

Our goal is to lay a foundation for your new career, but first we need to lay a foundation for the class itself. Articles, videos and online courses aren't a substitute for immersive learning, but they will give you a strong baseline so that we can accelerate through the fundamentals and quickly move into the meat and potatoes of front end development.

This prework will take some significant effort on your part, so I recommend that you begin dedicating at least 1-2 hours to it every day. As you work through these tasks, keep in mind that the goal is to *introduce* front end concepts so that they'll seem less foreign when we cover them in class. Don't sweat it if some concepts seem difficult to grasp the first time around.

All of this work should be completed by February 26th. While I understand that this is a very short period of time, you will likely feel behind if you haven't finished it by the time we start class.

In order to complete some of these tasks, you will need to register for an account with Treehouse. Treehouse is free for 14 days (which should be more than enough to finish the required courses), and you may cancel your account after completing the required work. We will not use it during class.
