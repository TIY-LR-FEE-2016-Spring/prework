# Git

Git is a tool that allows us to take snapshots of our code. It's a lot like "track changes" in Microsoft Word, but for your entire project. It also makes it easy to share code and collaborate with a team. We'll be using git for all of our assignments, working on group projects, and as a general tool to make our lives easier as developers.

To get started with git, complete [Github's Try Git course](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).

> NOTE! Don't worry about installing git on your computer. We'll be doing it together later.

# GitHub

GitHub is a hosting and collaboration tool for working with git repositories. You will need to be very comfortable with GitHub since all of our assignments will be assigned and delivered through this service. Many companies use either GitHub or a similar service. As we finish the class, your GitHub profile will serve as a large part of your portfolio.

1. Sign up for a GitHub account at [https://github.com](https://github.com)
2. Set up your profile with your first and last name, as well as a profile picture of you. This will help me learn your names faster, and make it easier to identify whose code I'm looking at.
3. [Email me](mailto:jonathan@theironyard.com) with the username you choose so that I can add you to the class organization on GitHub.
