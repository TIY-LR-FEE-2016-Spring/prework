# Familiarize Yourself with MacOS

Whether you're new to a Mac or have been using one for years, take some time to review [Apple's Mac Basics](https://www.apple.com/support/macbasics/).

# Operating System Updates

We want to minimize the amount of time spent fiddling with software, and maximize our time learning and writing code. To help mitigate this, everyone will be using MacOS X El Capitan 10.11.3 or greater. Before coming to class--and ideally, before staring other prework--please update your computer to the latest and greatest version of MacOS.

> WARNING: Upgrades on OS X are usually pretty good about not losing data, but any time you are modifying the operating system. I recommend that you backup your computer and documents using Time Machine and Dropbox.

# The Update Process

1. Open "App Store" on your computer by clicking the Apple icon in the top left of the screen, then selecting "App Store"
2. Click the "Updates" icon in the gray bar at the top of "App Store." It's the right most icon.
3. Give it a few seconds to search for updates, then select "Update All" to update all software on your Mac.

> WARNING: Major MacOS X upgrades can take a bit of time to complete and will require a restart. Plan on doing this in the evening or over a lunch break. If you have another computer available, all of the below assignments (except the terminal assignment) can be completed with any computer that has internet access and a web browser!

# A Note on Additional Software

Do not install software related to coding (even the software recommended in this prework) before the install party. We want to make sure that everyone is using the same versions, and that everything is installed in the correct order.
